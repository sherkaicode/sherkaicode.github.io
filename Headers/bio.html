          <h2>Francis Lance Jumawan</h2>
          <p>
            Greetings! I currently pursuing my studies at University of the Philippines Diliman - National Institute of Physics and have been actively involved in 
            my laboratory (High Energy Physics and Phenomenology laboratory) and some Student Organizations. My journey has been enriched by a continuous 
            drive to learn, explore, and contribute in meaningful ways.

      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Francis Lance T. Jumawan was born on July 30, 2003, and currently resides at Acacia Residence Halls, Quezon City, where he is pursuing his dreams of becoming a physicist. As the second oldest among four siblings, with three brothers and a younger sister, Francis grew up in a lively household that fostered both competition and camaraderie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up, Francis was an energetic child who enjoyed outdoor games, embracing the spirit of friendly competition and adventure. His early years were also marked by a strong affinity for mathematics, which saw him competing in various math contests and laying the groundwork for his future academic pursuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Francis’s passion for science became more pronounced during his time at Philippine Science High School - Central Mindanao Campus. There, he excelled in his studies, earning the Proficiency Award in Physics and consistently achieving high honors, distinguishing himself as a dedicated and talented student. Currently, Francis is a III-BS Physics student at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he continues to hone his skills in physics and computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of his academic life, Francis is deeply immersed in coding, often programming for fun as a way to challenge himself and explore new possibilities in the intersection of physics and technology. He balances his studies and coding passion with simple pleasures such as watching anime, reading manga, and catching up on much-needed sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Driven by the desire to leave a lasting legacy, Francis draws inspiration from legendary figures like Paul Dirac and other renowned physicists. He envisions a future where his contributions to physics resonate within the scientific community and beyond, creating a meaningful impact that will be remembered by generations to come. Guided by his personal motto, “Keep moving forward,” and the belief that it’s better to regret something done than something left undone, Francis is committed to a life of relentless pursuit of knowledge and excellence.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his sights set on leaving a mark on the world, Francis Lance T. Jumawan’s journey is just beginning, but his determination and passion make it clear that his legacy is one to watch unfold.
